% Description: A MATLAB script to determine specific weight, density and
% specific gravity of a sample of pop and compare results to the
% corresponding values for water at 20 degrees Celsius
%*************************************************************

%acceleration of gravity in m/s^2
g = 9.81

%density of water in kg/m^3
w = 1000

%User to input volume of can in milliliters
volume_of_can = input('\nEnter Volume of can\n\n ==>');

%User to input mass of can in kg
mass_of_full_can = input('\nEnter Mass of full can\n\n ==>');

%User to input weight of can in N
weight_of_empty_can = input('\nEnter Weight of empty of can\n\n ==>');

%Calculation of mass of empty can in kg
mass_of_empty_can = weight_of_empty_can./g

%Calculation for mass of empty can in kg
mass_of_pop_only = mass_of_full_can - mass_of_empty_can

%Conversion of volume of pop from millilitres to m^3
volume_of_pop_in_metre_cubed = volume_of_can.*(10^(-6))

%Calculation for density of pop in kg/m^3
density_of_pop_only = mass_of_pop_only./volume_of_pop_in_metre_cubed

%Calculation for specific weight of pop in N/m^3
specific_weight_of_pop = density_of_pop_only.*g

%Calculation for specific gravity of pop 
specific_gravity_of_pop = density_of_pop_only./w

%From the textbook the density and the specific weight of water at 20
%degrees celsius from Table B.2 - "Physical Properties of Water (SI Units)"
%from Appendix B of the textbook

%Density of water at 20 degrees Celsius in kg/m^3 
density_of_water_at_20degrees = 998.2 

%specific weight of at 20 degrees Celsius in N/m^3
specific_weight_of_water_at_20degrees = 9789

%Calculation for the specific gravity of water 
specific_gravity_of_water_at_20degrees = density_of_water_at_20degrees./w

%more or less than specific gravity of pop
